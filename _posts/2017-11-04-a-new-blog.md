I don't remember how many blogs I have ever had, probably more than ten sites. Now this's a new one. I am trying to be a freelancer, my friend Sergy convinced me that I should have a personal website to show my work. I agreed. When I want to bid a work from freelance webiste, or apply for a remote work. I don't know how to show my abilities. How can the employer would like to hire me if I just told them that I can do this. I won't hire myself if I were the employer. So this website is mainly for me to write down what I know about computer science, as well as showing my projects here. I clearly know it's hard to keep on writing technoical articles, but let me try once more.
